App for playing bagpipe bourdons

Bourdon Player  is an app for bagpipe players (or why not other musicians) who want to play against long drone notes.

You can build your chords from given bourdon notes, set the tuning, temperement and sound type - that otherwise would not be possible on bagpipe.

You can set the relative volume of each preset, also the individual volumes of the bourdon notes.
You can start/stop the sound from bluetooth speaker or pedal.

The app is built using Csound sound engine and Qt framework.
